# Abstract
We are two students trying to develop IA bot for the Platinum Rift 2 game. You can find the game at https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/platinum-rift-episode-2. You are free tu use our strategy to improve your AI bot, but don't try to copy our code and just use it in CodinGame.

# How to use

## IntelIJ

Clone this repository from IntelIJ. Then, you have to create a configuration with specific parameters :
- Main class : builder.FileBuilder
- Program arguments : src/main/java/Main.java

We use the FileBuilder made by Manwe, you can find it at https://github.com/Manwe56/competitive-programming/blob/master/src/main/java/builder/FileBuilder.java

Finaly, run the configuration, copy and paste the outputed file content in CodinGame IDE. You just have to chance the name of the main class to Player, because when it's build by default it's Main.
